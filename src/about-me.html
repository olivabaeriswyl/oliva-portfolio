                To start the day, I always drink a sugar-free tea, with a bag
                brewed to the extreme, and sometimes it's even black tea. :)

                I'm a curious person, I'm interested in a lot of things and I
                like to learn in the fields I'm passionate about. I'm also a
                perfectionist, so I put a lot of effort into my projects and try
                to give my best.

                Writing is one of my favorite escapes. Writing stories allows me
                to create and give free rein to my imagination. I also read,
                play sport and I like fashion. I love finding new clothing and
                decorating finds.

                Music is an essential part of my life. I listen to a lot of
                different genres depending on my mood: film and TV soundtracks,
                alternative rock and, above all, techno, which has an important
                place in my playlist!
